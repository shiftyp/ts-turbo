# Drive System Conversion Issues

> **Summary**: This section documents issues observed in the original JavaScript drive system code during the TypeScript migration process. Key issues include:

- Incomplete conversion of files such as `page_snapshot.ts`, which may lead to potential null reference errors and inconsistent type handling.
- Mismatches in type usage and interface definitions across drive system modules, including navigator, history, and form submission.
- Lack of explicit type definitions in parts of the drive system, resulting in implicit any types and potential runtime errors.

These issues highlight areas that require further attention to achieve full type safety and improve consistency with the overall Turbo framework. Future updates will address these conversion challenges with refined type definitions and stricter type checking.
