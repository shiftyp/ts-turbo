# Request Handling âœ…

> **Summary**: This section documents JavaScript-related issues discovered during the TypeScript migration related to HTTP request handling. The issues primarily involve URL mutation, inconsistent return value handling, and limited support for different response types. The TypeScript migration improved request handling by properly reconstructing request objects after URL changes, ensuring consistent boolean returns, and adding support for stream responses.

## 1. Request Handling Improvements

> **Summary**: This section addresses improvements to HTTP request handling. The original JavaScript code had potential mutation issues when changing request URLs, inconsistent return value handling in asynchronous methods, and limited support for different response types. The TypeScript migration fixed these issues by properly reconstructing request objects, standardizing return values, and adding support for stream responses.
- ðŸ”§ Updated `action` setter method to properly reconstruct the `FetchRequest` object with the new URL in [src/core/drive/form_submission.ts](src/core/drive/form_submission.ts)
  ```javascript
  // Before: Potential mutation issues
  set action(value) {
    this.formElement.action = value
  }
  
  // After: Proper reconstruction
  set action(value) {
    this.formElement.action = value
    // Reconstruct fetchRequest with new URL to avoid mutation issues
    this.fetchRequest = new FetchRequest(this, this.method, new URL(value))
  }
  ```
- ðŸ”§ Fixed return value handling in the `fetchRequest.perform()` method to ensure consistent boolean returns in [src/core/drive/form_submission.ts](src/core/drive/form_submission.ts)
  ```javascript
  // Before: Inconsistent return type
  async start() {
    const result = await this.fetchRequest.perform()
    if (result) {
      if (this.delegate.formSubmissionStarted) {
        this.delegate.formSubmissionStarted(this)
      }
    }
  }
  
  // After: Consistent boolean return
  async start() {
    const result = await this.fetchRequest.perform()
    // Explicitly check for true to handle boolean return value consistently
    if (result === true) {
      if (this.delegate.formSubmissionStarted) {
        await this.delegate.formSubmissionStarted(this)
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- ðŸ”§ Added the `acceptResponseType` method to the `FetchRequest` class to support stream responses in [src/http/fetch_request.ts](src/http/fetch_request.ts)
  ```javascript
  // Added method for stream support
  acceptResponseType(mimeType) {
    this.headers["Accept"] = [mimeType, this.headers["Accept"]].filter(Boolean).join(", ")
  }
  ```
