# Stream Reconversion

> **Summary**: This section documents the issues encountered with the stream-related files during the TypeScript migration. Initially, the following files were converted to TypeScript:

- `src/core/streams/stream_actions.ts`
- `src/core/streams/stream_message.ts`
- `src/core/streams/stream_message_renderer.ts`
- `src/elements/stream_element.ts`
- `src/elements/stream_source_element.ts`

However, the changes made during the migration were later discarded. This necessitates reconversion, during which the following issues should be addressed:

- **Type Definitions**: Ensure that all functions and variables in these modules have explicit type annotations to prevent implicit any types.
- **Interface Consistency**: Align the interfaces between implementations and type declarations, especially for stream actions and message handling.
- **Memory Management**: Improve event listener cleanup and reference handling to prevent memory leaks in stream-related elements.
- **Error Handling**: Standardize error handling to provide predictable and consistent behavior during stream processing.
- **Integration Testing**: Add comprehensive tests to validate the behavior of stream-related functions, ensuring that reconversion does not compromise functionality.

Future work includes reapplying the changes with these improvements and verifying that the TypeScript compiler catches all potential issues that were present in the original JavaScript codebase.
