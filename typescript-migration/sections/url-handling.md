# URL Handling and Backward Compatibility

> **Summary**: This section documents JavaScript-related issues discovered during the TypeScript migration related to URL handling and backward compatibility. The issues primarily involve deprecated URL properties, unsafe URL handling, and inconsistent response type handling. The TypeScript migration improved URL handling by adding backward compatibility for deprecated properties, implementing safer URL handling with proper undefined checks, and fixing inconsistent response type handling.

**Test Coverage**: [View URL Handling Tests](/src/tests/unit/url_handling_tests.js)

> **Note**: The URL handling tests verify backward compatibility for deprecated URL properties, safe URL handling with proper undefined checks, consistent response type handling, URL creation with proper error handling, and URL comparison with proper type handling. These tests ensure that the issues identified during the TypeScript migration are properly addressed in the JavaScript codebase.

## 1. URL Handling Improvements ‚úÖ

> **Summary**: This section addresses issues with URL handling and backward compatibility. The original JavaScript code was missing backward compatibility for deprecated URL properties and had unsafe URL handling in various locations. The TypeScript migration added backward compatibility by extending the URL prototype with required properties and implemented safer URL handling with proper undefined checks.
- üîß Added backward compatibility for deprecated URL properties in [src/core/index.ts](src/core/index.ts)
  ```javascript
  // Before: Missing backward compatibility for URL.absoluteURL
  // No implementation
  
  // After: Added absoluteURL property to URL prototype
  declare global {
    interface URL {
      absoluteURL: string
    }
  }
  
  // Extend URL prototype with absoluteURL property
  Object.defineProperty(URL.prototype, 'absoluteURL', {
    get() { return this.toString() }
  })
  ```
- üîß Fixed unsafe URL handling in various locations that could lead to runtime errors
  ```javascript
  // Before: Unsafe URL handling
  session.refresh(this.baseURI)
  
  // After: Safe URL handling with proper undefined checks
  session.refresh(this.baseURI, this.requestId ?? undefined)
  ```

## 2. Type Inconsistencies in Visit Options ‚úÖ

> **Summary**: This section focuses on fixing inconsistent response type handling in visit options. The original JavaScript code handled response types inconsistently, which could lead to runtime errors when accessing properties. The TypeScript migration fixed these issues with proper type checking and conversion between standard Response objects and VisitResponse objects.
- üêõ Fixed inconsistent response type handling that could lead to runtime errors in [src/core/index.ts](src/core/index.ts)
  ```javascript
  // Before: In JavaScript, response types were handled inconsistently
  // which could lead to runtime errors when accessing properties
  function visit(location, options = {}) {
    // No type checking for options.response
    // Could try to access properties like statusCode on a standard Response object
    if (options.response && options.response.statusCode) {
      // This would fail if options.response was a standard Response object
      // instead of a VisitResponse object with a statusCode property
    }
    session.visit(location, options)
  }
  
  // After: Fixed in TypeScript with proper type checking and conversion
  export function visit(location: string | URL, options: VisitOptions = {}): void {
    // Convert Response to VisitResponse if needed
    if (options.response && 'status' in options.response) {
      const response = options.response as unknown as Response
      const visitResponse: VisitResponse = {
        statusCode: response.status,
        redirected: response.redirected,
        responseHTML: undefined
      }
      options.response = visitResponse
    }
    session.visit(location, options)
  }
  ```
